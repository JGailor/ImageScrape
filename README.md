Image Scrape
============

A simple image scraper for the web that I'm using for testing some computer vision problems I'm working on.  Feel free to grab it and adapt it to your particular use case.  Simple code, easy to understand and modify, it was written for my own purposes, but if you have constructive criticism I'm always interested in hearing about it.

To run it, just make sure you do a bundle install

```
%> bundle install
```

And then you can run it like so.

```
%> ruby bin/image-scrape.rb url css-selector html-attribute <output-dir>
```

Have fun.
